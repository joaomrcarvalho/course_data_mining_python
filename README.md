# Data Mining course in Python (Portuguese)

Last here I was invited to teach a Data Mining course in Python (in Portuguese). Here are the jupyter notebooks that I built for the course. If you think they are useful feel free to use them for your own personal learning. If you have suggestions feel free to email me via joao.carvalho AT ua.pt and/or make a pull request.
